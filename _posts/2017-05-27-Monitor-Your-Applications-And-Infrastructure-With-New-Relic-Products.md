In this post, I will walk through some of the core products of New Relic and how these can help your company.

**New Relic APM (Application Performance Monitoring)** - Imagine a situation where you want to analyze performance of your application. You want to know the parts in your code which are performing poor or say you want to know the transaction that is taking too long to complete. With New relic APM, you can do all these with great ease. It gives a detailed performance report down to the code level and helps you with troubleshooting the errors and performance issues. New Relic APM does this by installing an agent in your application which allows it to gain insights into the transactions taking place in your application.

It provides an Application Performance Index which is a measure of how well your application is performing. The value lies between 0 and 1 with 1 being the most preferred state. So, you can configure the threshold for the API and setup alerts which will help you respond quickly to events.

**New Relic Infrastructure** - Imagine you are a company with thousands of servers in place. What would you do to monitor a plethora of servers in your infrastructure? How would you know which host is running a vulnerable package? The answer to all these is the New Relic Infrastructure. We agree that monitoring our applications is important to improve our services. However, with the advent of DevOps, it has become equally important to monitor our infrastructure.  

Some of the advantages of monitoring your infrastructure with New Relic are:

1. Allows you to detect and resolve the incidents faster therefore reducing the Mean Time To Resolve (MTTR) incidents.   

2. Track all the changes that are occurring across the hosts in your infrastructure. You can view a complete log history that enables you to track what's installed, updated, removed and almost everything that will help you analyze and make better decisions. CPU,
Load on disk, Network statistics are a few of the metrics that you can instantly look for.

3. Respond quick to security events - Imagine a new zero-day attack on an SSL library. With New Relic infrastructure in place, you can search for the vulnerable package by performing an infrastructure-wide search. This is amazing!

4. Offers support for managing Docker Containers and AWS Services via the AWS tags and metadata. This allows you to search the instance by the instance id/container id or even by using the image name.  


**New Relic Insights** - Insights allows you to gather all the data under one hood and offers real-time analytics so that you can
easily monitor and take actions. With Insights you can find the trends in your data, analyze user engagement and
much more. Moreover, it offers a variety of visualizations such as pie charts and histograms to visualize the data as per your needs.

Therefore, In a nutshell..

New Relic Insights + APM + Infrastructure -> a complete platform for monitoring, troubleshooting and optimizing your services :)
